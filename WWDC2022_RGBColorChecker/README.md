# üçè WWDC2022_RGBColorChecker_README

This is the first app I made.<br>
It is Swift Playground app (Xcode ver.) for WWDC 2022 .<br>
This is made with SwiftUI

## üé® RGB Color Checker Intro.

There are 3 functions that I wanted to create when I first made this app.  
1. Checking RGB Values on Image in your gallery and picture taken with the camera 
2. A Game that guess RGB values
3. Change from RGB to Hex or from Hex to RGB
   
But I couldn't make 3 three functions, but I made only the first one<br> I submitted it to WWDC 2022.
The Reason why I failed to make 3 functions, I changed the item 2days before the deadline.<br> 
Since it's my first app, I want to complete the functions, so I'm recording the process of adding functions after submission.
